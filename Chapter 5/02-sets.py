# Sets are collection of non repetitive or unordered elements.


d = {} # Empty dictionary.
print(d,type(d))

# s = {} returns <class 'dict'> don't use s = {} as it'll create an empty dictionary.

# We can create an empty set like this :-

s = set()
print(s,type(s))

S = {70,1,65,9,4,} # As it is non reprtitive it only takes 4 one time and the order is not fixed.
print(S)
